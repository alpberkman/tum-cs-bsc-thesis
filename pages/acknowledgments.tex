%TODO: Acknowledgments
I would like to take a moment to acknowledge people who have helped me with my thesis.
I am grateful to my supervisor Prof. Pramod Bhatotia for giving me a chance to work on this thesis.
This endeavor would not have been possible without Sebastian Reimers's and Theofilos Augoustis's help and support.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to them for both being understanding and holding me accountable at the same time.
Finally I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Nicola Crivellin for answering my many questions.
