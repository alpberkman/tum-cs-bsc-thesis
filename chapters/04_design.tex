The following chapter presents the core design decisions that were used to extend the Focaccia verifier with the reproducer.
Extra attention is given to the reproducer interface and the data that is taken from the verifier and how it relates to the whole verifier.

The reproducer is a direct extension for the verifier.
Therefore it is important to first understand how the verifier works, as all of the inputs of the reproducer stem from the verifier.
