\chapter{Future Work}\label{chapter:future_work}
As we wrap up this project, there are several directions to which it might go for its future development.
Among the options, we see three main directions.
By integrating fuzzing techniques, we can generate a wider array of test cases, which can lead to the discovery of more erroneous behavior within faulty instructions.

A different direction would be to add support for additional architectures like Arm.
As we mentioned in our introduction, given the vast number of devices powered by Arm processors, improving emulators for these systems could significantly ease the process of running Arm-specific programs on personal computers, extending the available software for them.

Lastly, it might be worthwhile to add support for segmentation faults
These bugs often introduce complex edge cases that can be challenging to debug.
Developing new tools to address these issues would be invaluable, though it demands a deep understanding of the x86 architecture and presents a formidable challenge.
Each of these paths builds on the foundation we've established and opens up new opportunities to enhance emulators' functionality and reach.

\section{Fuzzing for More Test Case Generation}
By adding fuzzing capabilities to our reproducer, we can preload the registers and memory values with random data to trigger further unexpected errors.
This approach can be beneficial because it can uncover hidden issues that might be difficult to notice.

For example, some bugs manifest only when multiple registers are set to specific values.
While our verifier can detect such scenarios, it might not catch additional bugs associated with the same instruction.
However, by using fuzzing, we can introduce random inputs into the binaries.
Furthermore, we can potentially trigger these hidden bugs.
Thus, fuzzing extends our ability to test the software more thoroughly.
Nonetheless, it is important to keep in mind that fuzzing can also take a lot of time before finding any useful results, and it is not a surefire way to find all the bugs.

\section{Support for ARM or RISC-V Binaries}
The computing landscape is rapidly evolving, with Arm devices getting more popular and RISC-V emerging as a new technology.
As these technologies become more common, we will need emulators for these architectures.
Moreover, like x86, these Arm and RISC-V emulators need to be faithful to their respective architectures.
Considering this, tools like the verifier and the reproducer would be invaluable for developing and polishing other emulators.

However, this is not a simple task, as each architecture uses its respective assembly instructions.
The reproducer has some code regarding memory address detection and registers that can be shared with other architectures.
However, it is still necessary to change the assembly instructions that are produced.

\section{Adding Support for Segfaults}
As discussed before, segmentation faults are difficult to debug with the current verifier.
However, we can add support to the verifier and add detection algorithms to the reproducer to increase the likelihood of reproducing errors.
This would first entail adding a mechanism to the verifier where if the emulator log is shorter than expected, it is considered a \ac{segfault}.
Then, in the reproducer, if the error is designated as a \ac{segfault}, we might try to replicate the exact memory access details.
This includes where the memory address belongs, its permission, page size, and alignment.
Adding these details would increase the likelihood of triggering the same bugs.
